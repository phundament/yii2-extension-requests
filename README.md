Yii 2 Extension Requests
========================

**Ideas "marketplace" for Yii 2 extensions**

Inspired by the requests section from packalyst.com, the issue tracker of this git repository functions as a platform to share ideas and information about Yii 2 extensions. 

True to GitHub's motto "Build software better, together.", we would like to invite every Yii extension developer to join this platform. Because not every feature will be implemented into the core framework, we want to make sure that additional features provided by extensions are implemented in the most economic way, whether by creating issues or pull requests for exisiting extensions or by discussing the architecture and features of an extension, before implementing it.

Before submitting a request, take a look at the [existing Yii 2 extensions on Packagist](https://packagist.org/search/?type=yii2) and [requested extensions](https://github.com/phundament/yii2-extension-requests/issues).

But if you haven't still found what you're looking for, please feel free to create an issue to [request a new extension](https://github.com/phundament/yii2-extension-requests/issues/new). Make to add a detailed description about the features and purpose about the extension and please request only extensions which can be implemented in a generic way so they can be shared with others.

Your participation is highly welcome!

*But, just to have it be said: "There's no guarantee someone will create the extension you requested."*
